<strong> How can we collaborate on education analytics when we work in closed data environments?</strong>

An open-source community for education data analysts seems like an oxymoron because most of the student-level data that we work with is private, and data formats are specific to agencies. We hope that we can tackle these two problems by drawing on the OpenSDP community for help making realistic synthetic data that can be used to develop, share, and present analyses, and embracing data standards whenever possible.

The repositories below show OpenSDP's preliminary attempts to tackle the synthetic data challenge, in a tale of three datasets. We encourage you to explore the open-source data engine, the Faketucky dataset, and to consider using publicly available data. Contact OpenSDP at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) to discuss ways to contribute to the evolution of open-source synthetic data.
