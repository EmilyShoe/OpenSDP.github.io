description: Repositories of code and guidance to answer key questions in important education domains.

SDP and user-contributed analyses will be housed in repositories on Github. Each topic-based repository will include web guides with code and supports in Stata or R. The example Stata and R guides below are based on the [Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use), modified to work with synthetic data generated by our simulation engine. The College-Going Pathways guides and code will also work with college-going analysis files prepared to the [SDP data specification]({{ "/assets/images/sdp_college_going_analysis_file_data_specification.pdf" | relative_url }}).

 OpenSDP is working on developing realistic synthetic data that mirrors typical school system data tables stored in the Common Education Data Standards format, so that we can host open-source code to take sample data, or your own data, all the way from raw data to finished analyses. If you'd like to get involved, please reach out to us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
